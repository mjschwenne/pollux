* Scripts

** =get_proto_history_json.fish=

When given as arguments a GitHub user and repo, it will use the GitHub API to query for =proto= files
in that repo, find each commit which updated that file and then output a JSON blob into
=$owner-$repo.json= in the current working directory.

Several examples are included. 

* Repos

Here is a collection of repos we might be interested in, listed in no particular order. Some of the
repos came from looking at packages which import the =go= protobuf library, but a lot of them are from
looking at repositories with a high number of stars and the "protobuf" GitHub tag or test suites in
protobuf language implementations.

** Observations

With Grackle, we could arbitrarily handled the parts of protobuf we wanted to. That is no longer the
case. Two syntactic structures we ignored with grackle but would want here are

- Nested message definition
- Defining =grpc= services
